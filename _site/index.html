    <h3>Deb McIntosh - A Strong Voice for Ward 9</h3>
    <p>
      Deb McIntosh has a proven track record of achievement, leadership and fiscal responsibility.
      She strives for collaborative action with community partners to generate creative solutions,
      seize opportunities and complete projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is time for Greater Sudbury to develop a fresh vision for the community in which we want
      to live, work, learn and play.
    </p>

    <p>Our community needs:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>To collectively re-imagine our future and put into place action steps to achieve our long-term goals.</li>
        <li>Use innovative and creative ideas to maintain a level of service while keeping taxes down.</li>
        <li>To assess the long-term economic, social and environmental impacts of the decisions we make today.</li>
        <li>To find innovative and sustainable solutions that address our key infrastructures as conventional thinking
          and routinely following past practices are not working.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Our Community, Our Future</b></p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Transportation is Important to us.</b><br/>
            ROADWAYS: The community is asking the municipality to “fix the roads”.
            Let’s re-think our road investments and do a better job of fixing the roadways we have,
            rather than creating new roadways that we can’t afford to maintain.
            PUBLIC TRANSIT: An efficient and effective public transit system is important for not only
            labour mobility and our aging population, but also for our environment and human health.
            The creation of a long-term transit strategy is essential to achieving these outcomes.
            ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION (WALKING & CYCLING): Children deserve the right to walk or cycle to
            their destinations such as school or a playground. Keeping the children in mind is
            fundamental when making transportation decisions.
        </li>
