        <h2>About Deb</h2>
        <h3>Deb McIntosh - A Community Leader for Ward 9</h3>

        <p>As the current Ward 9 city councillor, Deb McIntosh has <span>demonstrated over the past four years</span> that she <span>works effectively</span> with residents, business and community groups, and all levels of government <span>to get things done</span>.</p>

        <p>Deb extended the <span>fiscal responsibility</span> and <span>high achievement level</span> she demonstrated during her career in Sudbury as an accountant, community volunteer and Executive Director of Rainbow Routes Association <span>into her work as a councillor</span>. </p>

        <p>Since 2014, Ward 9 residents have appreciated Deb’s <span>ability to listen</span> to their concerns, help them <span>come up with new and alternative approaches</span> to projects or concerns, and be the first to pitch in to <span>make things happen</span>.</p>

        <p>Deb is <span>committed</span> to using her experience on city council to work for Ward 9. She will continue to be <span>responsive</span> to the ward’s needs and interests. At the same time, Deb will put her <span>energy</span> and <span>critical thinking skills</span> into collaborating on projects that will benefit the city as a whole. </p>

        <p>Deb capably demonstrated her ability to <span>identify and troubleshoot critical issues</span> as <span>chair</span> of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planning Committee</li>
          <li>Audit Committee</li>
        </ul>

        <p>and as a member of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>City Council</li>
          <li>Finance &amp Administration Committee</li>
          <li>Greater Sudbury Economic Development Board</li>

          <li>Hiring committee for the City’s Chief Administrative Officer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"One of the best things about being a city councillor is getting to know and work with the people in Ward 9. It is very gratifying to have worked together on community issues and projects, and I am motivated to continuing that work for another term."</p>
        <p>Deb</p>

        <h3>Our community -- Our future</h3>

        <h4>My pledge to Ward 9 2018-2022</h4>
        <p>When I ran for the Ward 9 council seat in 2014, I made three promises and laid out a four-part platform that would inform my decision making over the term of council.</p>

        <p>I promised to work hard, not touch or influence the Healthy Community Initiative (HCI) funds and to vote according to the direction of the Ward 9 voters regarding shopping hours. I believe I worked hard, I did not influence the distribution of any HCI funds and I voted to deregulate shopping hours as the majority of Ward 9 wished.</p>

        <p>For the next term of council, armed with the knowledge gained over the past four years, I promise again to work hard and to continue to make decisions based on the same platform: fostering economic growth, protecting water, championing smart transportation and demonstrating good governance.</p>

        <p>"You helped me put a curb in front of my house when the builder I bought from said he would and then didn’t. The city wanted $1200 from me. I contacted you and within a month I got a curb put in at the home builder’s cost. I cannot thank you enough for your help with that! Got my vote!"</p>
