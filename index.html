        <p>As the current Ward 9 city councillor, Deb McIntosh has <span class="bold">demonstrated over the past four years</span> that she <span class="bold">works effectively</span> with residents, business and community groups, and all levels of government <span class="bold">to get things done</span>.</p>

        <p>Deb extended the <span class="bold">fiscal responsibility</span> and <span class="bold">high achievement level</span> she demonstrated during her career in Sudbury as an accountant, community volunteer and Executive Director of Rainbow Routes Association <span class="bold">into her work as a councillor</span>. </p>

        <p>Since 2014, Ward 9 residents have appreciated Deb’s <span class="bold">ability to listen</span> to their concerns, help them <span class="bold">come up with new and alternative approaches</span> to projects or concerns, and be the first to pitch in to <span class="bold">make things happen</span>.</p>

        <p>Deb is <span class="bold">committed</span> to using her experience on city council to work for Ward 9. She will continue to be <span class="bold">responsive</span> to the ward’s needs and interests. At the same time, Deb will put her <span class="bold">energy</span> and <span>critical thinking skills</span> into collaborating on projects that will benefit the city as a whole. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Planning Committee</li>
          <li>Audit Committee</li>

        <p class="quote">One of the best things about being a city councillor is getting to know and work with the people in Ward 9. It is very gratifying to have worked together on community issues and projects, and I am motivated to continuing that work for another term.</p>

        <h2>Our community -- Our future</h2>

        <h3>Deb's pledge to Ward 9: 2018-2022</h3>
        <p>When Deb ran for the Ward 9 council seat in 2014, she made three promises and laid out a four-part platform that would inform her decision making over the term of council.</p>

        <p>She promised to work hard, not touch or influence the Healthy Community Initiative (HCI) funds and to vote according to the direction of the Ward 9 voters regarding shopping hours. Following her election, Deb kept these promises, and has worked tirelessly and collaboratively with many constituents and local businesses to improve the quality of life in Ward 9 and the City of Greater Sudbury.</p>

        <p>For the next term of council, armed with the knowledge gained over the past four years, Deb promises to continue to work hard and make decisions based on a similar platform: fostering economic growth, protecting water, championing smart transportation and demonstrating good governance.</p>

        <p class="quote">You helped me put a curb in front of my house when the builder I bought from said he would and then didn’t. The city wanted $1200 from me. I contacted you and within a month I got a curb put in at the home builder’s cost. I cannot thank you enough for your help with that! Got my vote!</p>
