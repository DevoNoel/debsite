    <h3>Deb McIntosh - A Strong Voice for Ward 9</h3>
    <p>
      Deb McIntosh has a proven track record of achievement, leadership and fiscal responsibility.
      She strives for collaborative action with community partners to generate creative solutions,
      seize opportunities and complete projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is time for Greater Sudbury to develop a fresh vision for the community in which we want
      to live, work, learn and play.
    </p>

    <p>Our community needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To collectively re-imagine our future and put into place action steps to achieve our long-term goals.</li>
      <li>Use innovative and creative ideas to maintain a level of service while keeping taxes down.</li>
      <li>To assess the long-term economic, social and environmental impacts of the decisions we make today.</li>
      <li>To find innovative and sustainable solutions that address our key infrastructures as conventional thinking
        and routinely following past practices are not working.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Our Community, Our Future</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Transportation is Important to us.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>ROADWAYS: The community is asking the municipality to “fix the roads”.
          Let’s re-think our road investments and do a better job of fixing the roadways we have,
          rather than creating new roadways that we can’t afford to maintain.</li>
          <li>PUBLIC TRANSIT: An efficient and effective public transit system is important for not only
          labour mobility and our aging population, but also for our environment and human health.
          The creation of a long-term transit strategy is essential to achieving these outcomes.</li>
          <li>ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION (WALKING & CYCLING): Children deserve the right to walk or cycle to
          their destinations such as school or a playground. Keeping the children in mind is
          fundamental when making transportation decisions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Accountability and Transparency is important for Good Governance</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The creation of a Permanent Auditor General’s Office and the Appointment of an Integrity
          Commissioner is essential for our community</li>
          <li>The Ward 9 Healthy Community Initiative funds (aka “Slush Funds”) will be administered by
          City Staff using operating guidelines and an application process.</li>
          <li>People are not just passive consumers, they need to be active citizens and we need to help
          them engage. We need to empower people to help tackle the big issues.</li>
          <li>It is important that our community consider a policy of Open Public Data as other cities
          have done, in order to be efficient, accessible and accountable; as well as providing economic
          opportunities for businesses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Growing Greater Sudbury (Commit to the promise of our community)</b><br/>
        We need to become the Best Place in Ontario to start and grow a business.
        We need to look at what we are really good at and build upon that foundation to grow our economy
        and provide new and jobs Downtown is not in Ward 9, but a healthy community has a strong heart in
        the core of its downtown. The municipal government should focus on getting behind good ideas that
        spur economic activity.
      </li>
      <li><b>Balancing the Budget</b><br/>
        Deb will bring her track record of fiscal responsibility and business skills to the table to fairly
        balance the City’s Budget. We need to keep our taxes at an affordable ‘to all’ level. Deb will work
        to build connections between the City’s many institutions, private business and community leaders
        to create a fiscally responsible municipal government while maintaining our core values.
      </li>
      <li><b>Water Quality</b><br/>
        We need to be proactive in protecting one our greatest resources.  We need to work with Laurentian’s
        Living with Lakes Centre, the Greater Sudbury Watershed Alliance and its associated groups as well as
        the people who live on or near our community’s water ways.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>We are all in this together!</h3>
    <p>Deb McIntosh will be responsive to the Ward 9 Community and its needs, while recognizing that what is good for
      the other wards, and for the City as a whole, can also be beneficial to the residents of Ward 9.</p>
    <p>Our community needs critical and innovative thinking that Deb McIntosh can deliver with each issue, project and
      opportunity she encounters.</p>
